# M.M.-Detecting

View short Game Demo here: https://youtu.be/52514hytBaE

This game was a demo for my Game Development course at UTSA! I wanted to make an open world game with a fun intriguing story and something thats easy to play for all skill levels! Explore the town, collect clues, and solve the mysterious disappearance of the town people while playing as a novice detective on his most confusing case! While the current game is only a prototype I do have big asperations to go back and finish the game! All programming, story writing, and sprites were all done by me (don't judge, im a programmer not an artist). Music was done by my talented cousin Daniel Alvarado: https://www.youtube.com/@DanielAlvarado1 .
